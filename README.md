1) To view, download or clone files from the repository.
2) The build folder contains the build version of the project (version 1.0).
3) To start the assembly, write the following commands in the command line of the terminal:

The folder is the main one.
It contains such folders as:
1) the template (here are the elements of our basis html page)
2) styles (We created several subfolders in the style folder in which there are:
     - Font styles (base folder).
     - Styles for html page elements (in the component folder).
     - The utilities folder contains the variable and mixins that were used in the project. 
     - And in the vendors folder files are stored to create icons (fontAwesome)
